                                will be type checked and a TypeError will be
                                raised if the wrong type is input.
                                Defaults to True
            _path_to_item (tuple/list): This is a list of keys or values to

                                False if the variable names in the input data
                                are pythonic names, e.g. snake case (default)

                                classes that we have traveled through so that
                                if we see that class again we will not use its

                                once using the discriminator, and pick Dog.
                                Then in Dog, we will make an instance of the
