                                Defaults to True
            _path_to_item (tuple/list): This is a list of keys or values to

                                False if the variable names in the input data
                                are pythonic names, e.g. snake case (default)

                                once using the discriminator, and pick Dog.
                                Then in Dog, we will make an instance of the
                                Animal class but this time we won't travel
