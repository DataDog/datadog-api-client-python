        A service level objective object includes a service level indicator, thresholds
        for one or more timeframes, and metadata (`name`, `description`, `tags`, etc.).

        :param created_at: Creation timestamp (UNIX time in seconds)

            Always included in service level objective responses.
        :type created_at: int, optional

        :param creator: Object describing the creator of the shared element.
        :type creator: Creator, optional

        :param description: A user-defined description of the service level objective.

            Always included in service level objective responses (but may be `null`).
            Optional in create/update requests.
        :type description: str, none_type, optional

        :param groups: A list of (up to 20) monitor groups that narrow the scope of a monitor service level objective.

            Included in service level objective responses if it is not empty. Optional in
            create/update requests for monitor service level objectives, but may only be
            used when then length of the `monitor_ids` field is one.
        :type groups: [str], optional

        :param id: A unique identifier for the service level objective object.

            Always included in service level objective responses.
        :type id: str, optional

        :param modified_at: Modification timestamp (UNIX time in seconds)

            Always included in service level objective responses.
        :type modified_at: int, optional

        :param monitor_ids: A list of monitor ids that defines the scope of a monitor service level
            objective. **Required if type is `monitor`**.
        :type monitor_ids: [int], optional

        :param monitor_tags: The union of monitor tags for all monitors referenced by the `monitor_ids`
            field.
            Always included in service level objective responses for monitor service level
            objectives (but may be empty). Ignored in create/update requests. Does not
            affect which monitors are included in the service level objective (that is
            determined entirely by the `monitor_ids` field).
        :type monitor_tags: [str], optional

        :param name: The name of the service level objective object.
        :type name: str

        :param query: A metric SLI query. **Required if type is `metric`**. Note that Datadog only allows the sum by aggregator
            to be used because this will sum up all request counts instead of averaging them, or taking the max or
            min of all of those requests.
        :type query: ServiceLevelObjectiveQuery, optional

        :param tags: A list of tags associated with this service level objective.
            Always included in service level objective responses (but may be empty).
            Optional in create/update requests.
        :type tags: [str], optional

        :param thresholds: The thresholds (timeframes and associated targets) for this service level
            objective object.
        :type thresholds: [SLOThreshold]

        :param type: The type of the service level objective.
