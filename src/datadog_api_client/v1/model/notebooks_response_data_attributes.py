                                will be type checked and a TypeError will be

                                Defaults to True
            _path_to_item (tuple/list): This is a list of keys or values to

                                False if the variable names in the input data
                                are pythonic names, e.g. snake case (default)

                                If omitted no type conversion is done.
            _visited_composed_classes (tuple): This stores a tuple of
                                classes that we have traveled through so that
                                if we see that class again we will not use its

                                allOf includes Animal, we move through Animal
                                once using the discriminator, and pick Dog.
                                Then in Dog, we will make an instance of the
                                Animal class but this time we won't travel
                                through its discriminator because we passed in
