        Keyword Args:
            configured_alert_ids ([int]): [optional] A list of SLO monitors IDs that reference this SLO. This field is returned only when `with_configured_alert_ids` parameter is true in query.
            created_at (int): [optional] Creation timestamp (UNIX time in seconds)  Always included in service level objective responses.
            creator (Creator): [optional]
            description (str, none_type): [optional] A user-defined description of the service level objective.  Always included in service level objective responses (but may be `null`). Optional in create/update requests.
            groups ([str]): [optional] A list of (up to 20) monitor groups that narrow the scope of a monitor service level objective.  Included in service level objective responses if it is not empty. Optional in create/update requests for monitor service level objectives, but may only be used when then length of the `monitor_ids` field is one.
            id (str): [optional] A unique identifier for the service level objective object.  Always included in service level objective responses.
            modified_at (int): [optional] Modification timestamp (UNIX time in seconds)  Always included in service level objective responses.
            monitor_ids ([int]): [optional] A list of monitor ids that defines the scope of a monitor service level objective. **Required if type is `monitor`**.
            monitor_tags ([str]): [optional] The union of monitor tags for all monitors referenced by the `monitor_ids` field. Always included in service level objective responses for monitor service level objectives (but may be empty). Ignored in create/update requests. Does not affect which monitors are included in the service level objective (that is determined entirely by the `monitor_ids` field).
            name (str): [optional] The name of the service level objective object.
            query (ServiceLevelObjectiveQuery): [optional]
            tags ([str]): [optional] A list of tags associated with this service level objective. Always included in service level objective responses (but may be empty). Optional in create/update requests.
            thresholds ([SLOThreshold]): [optional] The thresholds (timeframes and associated targets) for this service level objective object.
