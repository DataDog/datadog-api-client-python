                                will be type checked and a TypeError will be
                                raised if the wrong type is input.
                                Defaults to True
            _path_to_item (tuple/list): This is a list of keys or values to
                                drill down to the model in received_data
                                when deserializing a response

                                are serialized names, as specified in the OpenAPI document.
                                False if the variable names in the input data
                                are pythonic names, e.g. snake case (default)
            _configuration (Configuration): the instance to use when
                                deserializing a file_type parameter.

                                classes that we have traveled through so that
                                if we see that class again we will not use its
                                discriminator again.

                                For example if Animal has a discriminator
                                petType and we pass in "Dog", and the class Dog
                                allOf includes Animal, we move through Animal
                                once using the discriminator, and pick Dog.
                                Then in Dog, we will make an instance of the
                                Animal class but this time we won't travel
                                through its discriminator because we passed in
